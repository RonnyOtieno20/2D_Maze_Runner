## About the Project

MazeRunner is a project developed as part of my portfolio for Holberton School. It demonstrates my passion for game development, problem-solving, and creating engaging user experiences within the constraints of a command-line interface.

Some key features of MazeRunner include:

- Procedural Maze Generation: Every game presents a unique maze challenge.
- ASCII Rendering: Experience the maze in beautifully crafted ASCII art.
- Vim-style Navigation: Use h, j, k, l keys for efficient movement through the maze.
- Save and Load: Pause your adventure and resume it later!
- Scoring System: Challenge yourself to reach the exit in the fewest moves and shortest time.
